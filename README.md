My first Odin project. Building a simple website for recipes to practice the HTML knowledge I have acquired. 

30/10/24: 
I have used my little knowledge to make a simple webiste with links, headings, buttons, ordered lists, unordered list and pictures. This was fun!

The recipes are from meny.no and matprat.no.

01/11/24: Styled the index page with CSS. Took way longer than it should, but it was fun!
